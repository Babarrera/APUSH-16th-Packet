                        <td>• <strong>Why "King Cotton"?</strong> Cotton became the dominant and most profitable export crop in the US, accounting for nearly 60% of American exports by the Civil War. Its economic power led Southerners like James Hammond to boast "Cotton is King," believing it gave the South immense international leverage.<br><br>
                        • <strong>Where does the South expand?</strong> The South expanded into the "Old Southwest"—the Black Belt region of western Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana. This was fueled by "Alabama Fever," a massive migration of white Southerners and their slaves after the War of 1812.</td>

                        <td>• <strong>Is the North Innocent?</strong> No. The text states there was a "direct" connection. Northern merchants provided shipping, insurance, and brokerage for the cotton trade. Furthermore, fortunes made from the slave trade and cotton were invested in northern industrial development, such as the textile mills in Lowell, Massachusetts.</td>

                        <td>A Slave Society in a Changing World</td>
                        <td>• Attitudes toward slavery <strong>hardened</strong> after the cotton gin made it incredibly profitable. While the North abolished slavery and invested in industry, railroads, and cities, the South remained a rural, agricultural society. Its capital was tied up in land and slaves, and it lagged behind in infrastructure and industrialization.</td>

                        <td>• <strong>What is this?</strong> The forced migration of over 1 million enslaved people from the Upper South (VA, MD) to the Deep South (AL, MS) to meet the labor demand of the cotton boom. This "coffle" of chained people was a brutal domestic slave trade that shattered families on a massive scale, larger than the Atlantic slave trade to North America.</td>

The growth of the slave population through natural increase (not importation) and living in larger groups on plantations allowed this community to solidify.</td>

                        <td>It <strong>postponed the Civil War</strong> but did not resolve the underlying issue of slavery. It highlighted the deep <strong>sectional divisions</strong> that would only intensify in the coming decades.</td>
